The goal of our work is to estimate minimum or systolic and maximum or diastolic volumes of the left ventricle from the dataset of MRI-images. This volume is used by practitioners to compute an ejection fraction: the fraction of outbound blood pumped from the heart with each heartbeat. This measurement can predict heart failure along with a large amount of cardiac disease.
